 The Selenium WebDriver's Advanced User Interactions API allows us to perform operations from
keyboard events and simple mouse events to complex events such as dragging-and-dropping,
holding a key and then performing mouse operations by using the Actions class, and building
a complex chain of events exactly like a user doing these manually.
The Actions class implements the builder pattern to create a composite action containing a
group of other actions

We need to create an instance of the Actions class by passing the instance of driver class
to the constructor in the following way:
Actions builder = new Actions(driver);
