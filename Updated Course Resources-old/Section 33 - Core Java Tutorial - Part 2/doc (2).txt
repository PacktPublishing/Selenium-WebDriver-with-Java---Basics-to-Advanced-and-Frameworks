Constructors in Java
A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize an object.Every class has a constructor,if we don't explicitly declare a constructor for any java class the compiler builds a default constructor for that class. A constructor does not have any return type.

A constructor has same name as the class in which it resides. Constructor in Java can not be abstract, static, final or synchronized. These modifiers are not allowed for constructor.

class Car
{
 String name ;
 String model;
 Car( )    //Constructor 
 {
  name ="";
  model="";
 }
}
