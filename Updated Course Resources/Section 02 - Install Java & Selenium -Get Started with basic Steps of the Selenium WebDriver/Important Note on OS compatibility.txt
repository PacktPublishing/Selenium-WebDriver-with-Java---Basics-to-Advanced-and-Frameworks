Important Note on OS compatibility
There are no differences in setup wise for (Selenium,Java)  in WIndows and MAC. Both OS have same set of instructions for configuration. The only difference we have is setting JAVA_HOME which we have clearly seen on how to do that in both Windows and MAC. Apart from this everything is same!   Cheers!
