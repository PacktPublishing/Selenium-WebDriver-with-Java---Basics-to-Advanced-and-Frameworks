Important Note about next section
Hey Quick Note -

We shall pause our selenium discussion for a moment and go over some part of core java basics in the next section.

After that we shall resume the selenium topics as usual.  I am introducing few java lectures here as these are basic fundamentals one need to understand to resume with selenium training.

If you are already aware of core java basics ( Variables, Datatypes, Strings, Arrays, Arraylist, For loop,if else, Methods, objects).  -  then please feel free to skip next section and continue with Selenium topics.

Good luck!
